- MNIST digit classification.py: This script implements a simple neural network for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The network is trained using a backpropagation algorithm with momentum.
- bayes-1.py: This script implements the Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection.
- kmeans.py: This script implements the k-means clustering algorithm. It includes functions for initializing cluster centers, assigning data points to clusters, and updating cluster centers.
